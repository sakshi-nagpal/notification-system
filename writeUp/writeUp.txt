From the problem, the following conclusions has been drawn:

1. To notify the users as per their characters subscription, we need following collections:
    a. Users : Users that subscribe particular character.
    b. Characters : Gossip Girl characters
    c. Subscription : Its keeps the subscription type of users
    d. Activities : it is a capped collection contains data of user subscribed activities

2. MongoDB will automatically close a cursor when the client has exhausted all results in the cursor.
   So using a tailable cursor for Activities collection

3. Application Flow
    a. Iniatially all the Activities present have field {"read": false}.
    b. After selection any user from the dropdown, its corresponding Activities field "read" has been updated to false.
    c. Only new notifications will be seen on view.
    d. After every 20 secs new notifications are added for each User.
